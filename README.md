# Python
This Repo's goal is to toy around with Python and to experiment with it.
First assignment given to me by a friend to play with is the following:

Longest Word
Have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen parameter being passed and return the longest word in the string. If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length. Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty. Words may also contain numbers, for example "Hello world123 567"
Examples
Input: "fun&!! time"
Output: timeInput: "I love dogs"
Output: love
